- If you plan on pushing AI-generated code/edits, please consider opening a pull request so the team can review your changes.

- Before working in a local IDE, make sure to fetch the most recent changes.

- After finishing a local work session, _always_ push your commit:
  - Even if you're not done, make a development branch and maintain your work there.
  - This keeps things clean and easier to navigate.
